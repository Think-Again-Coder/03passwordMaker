# Password Maker 
---

## Week 03 Challenge Accepted

### Introduction: 

This project was intended to help the user generate a random password by asking a series of questions about the kind of password they require. The user is asked about uppercase, lowercase, and special characters along with a specific length between 8 and 33 characters long. 
### Highlights:

The Password Maker was built with vanilla javascript, CSS, and HTML. It includes arrays for the characters that may be chosen. The code includes examples of if and else statements. A variety of methods are being used to organize the data for a unique password built on criteria chosen by the user. 

The Image here represents an example of a randomly generated password.
